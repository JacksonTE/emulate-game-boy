Optionally, you can place boot ROM files into this `bootrom` directory. Otherwise the `Emulator` will skip this step and automatically be put into to its post-boot state.

To use your own boot ROM file, run the `emulate-game-boy-app.exe` executable and provide the file name with arguments `--bootrom <filename.extension>`.

Currently, only the original DMG-01 Game Boy and its boot ROM are supported.
